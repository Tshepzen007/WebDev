    <p>“Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself” - George Bernard Shaw
        Allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is Tshepang Ramonyadiwa and I am a BSc Computer Science graduate who majored in both Computer Science and Mathematics at the Nelson Mandela University . In my final year of study, I went beyond the scope by implementing APIs which would assist in mechanism such as sending an SMS and Email with the booking confirmation as well as a link which consisted of a QR Code to scan. This was done in ASP.Net framework as well as C#. As I result, I got a distinction for my contribution towards the project 
         In addition, I am an official member of the Golden Key International Honours Society who aspires to become a Software Developer. 
        To add onto that , my passions lie in the tech industry. As a result, I tend to read up on the latest technological advances in my leisure. 
        In addition, my hobbies include growing social connections with other talented individuals in tech space as well as playing football with friends.
        In closure,the game of football is one to be admired. Thus, I have come to an epiphany:  life is like the game itself, you must have goals. My biggest goal is to make a contribution through emerging technologies such as AI, Web 3.0 and Blockchain in the near future.
